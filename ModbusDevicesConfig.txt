**Modbus Devices**
**This config file is for modbus devices that are not Yokogawa Recorders
**Format is as follows:
**	Device Name: (Name of Device)
**	IP Address: (IP Address of Device)
**	Slave number: (Slave address of device: 1 to 255)
**	Priority: Priority number (1, 2, or 3)
**	Registers: (start register), (end register) *note 1
**	Data Type: (Type of data) *note 2
**	(tag 1 name), (Units), (Decimal/Bit Position) *note 3, (register) *note 4
**	(tag 2 name), "", "", ""
**	ect... *note 5
**note 1: If Data Type is either big endian or little endian, make sure that the 
**	  number of registers from start register to end register are even.
**	  (i.e. registers 2000 to 2007 indicate 8 registers which is even)
**note 2: Acceptable data types are short holding, short input, big endian
**	  holding, big endian input, little endian holding, little endian input,
**	  single bit holding, and single bit input. The holding and input 
**	  determines whether the data is in a holding register or an input
**	  register.
**note 3: Give the number of decimals if the data type is short, big endian, or 
**	  little endian. If the device registers contain decimal information,
**	  put a 0 in for decimal. If the data type is single bit, give the bit
**	  position.
**note 4: Give the register value. If data type is big endian or little endian
**	  data is stored in two consecutive 16 bit registers, put the register
**	  that is the lowest register. (i.e. If data is stored in registers 2000
**	  and 2001, put 2000)
**note 5: You can continue naming tags using the tag format. Or to read another
**	  chunk of registers from the same device, repeat the format starting at
**	  the "Registers: " postion.  To start a new device repeat entire format
**	  starting at the "Device Name: " position. Also if the port number is not
**	  502, it can be set using a line marked "Port: ".
